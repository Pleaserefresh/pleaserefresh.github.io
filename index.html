        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I was born, rised and live in Cracow from 1989. My passion is MTB, forest, Gaming, and writing some code
            <br> in forest I like to spend time on MTBike and take a deep breath of fresh air around and Air it self.
            <br> I like to play retro games like Contra, Mario, Chess and LoL. Board games are second in the list.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a big fan of OpenSource and I want to be part of this community.
            <br>That is why i will share with you those things that i create or reuse.

        <h3>"The Plan"</h3>
        <p>
            The Plan is simple. Learn Java in practice, creating an aplication for the Polish RPG issued by the publishing house MAG in 2001. 
        </br> It will give oportunity to play without storyteller. The app will store all the sotries, beastiary, items, and character statistics. 
    </br> The most important thing is that it will be free to non comercial use, available as repository on GitHub. And everybody will be able to add own stories to the game. 
    </br> The project seems to be a big one, so keep the fingers crossed and see you soon. 
        <h4>"First Artcile"</h4>
        <p>
            Maybe my first article on website should be about the need of learning? What we get from learning and what can we give back to the World for that opportunity we got from Mother Earth? Itâ€™s not hard to say that people got everything because of the science
            and learning, but we should notice that it seems that we forgot about fact why we can get all those things we have. We ,as people, are able to space travel, to discover our world and underwater world as well, we are changing not only our reality,
            but reality of Worlds fauna and flora too.
