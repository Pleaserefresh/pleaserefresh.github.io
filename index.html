        <p>I have starded to write some code in 2020,for fun, and i would like to keep it this way.
            <br> This site is under construction so
            <em>Pleaserefresh</em> in while.
            <br> I would like to share with you all that I have learnd. I like to play with Arduino as well,
            <br> so you can find here some hardware projects too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I first time get into the electronics I have noticed that Open Source Sofware and Hardware
            <br> are close to my imagination of future projects, etics and morality.
            <br> It is not just all about get free software and hardware, but to improve it and share it later
            <br> with the community and leave the feedback to the original source.
