            "Coding for fun not for money"
        </h3>
        <p>
            In my opinion, if you want to start programming, you have to feel the need to do so.
            <br>My point is that the need will lead you to the language you should start learning.

            <br>I want to create an application that will run on any operating system or device and will be used in my daily life.
            <br>So I started learning Java.
            <br>My skills can't get the best results right now, but as I say
            <br>when I code for fun, I only count to get better results for my work, with no financial pressure.
            <br>I already have the first repository,
            <br>is run on the command line, on the Beaufort scale.
            <br>You will find it
            <a href="https://github.com/Pleaserefresh/beaufortScale">here</a>. And if you like to join me in some kind project, let me know on
