            <br>
            On market are many commercial system almost ready to use, but the issue is that they are very expensive.

            That is why I am working on system which will cheap as possible and working just like commercial products, 
            <br>
            or even better because the project will be evolving all the time, and the community will have an massive impact on the project.
